The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest
particles of debris in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons,
ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is special to us, there are billions of
stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.

<p>
Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day
temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures
can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system that title belongs to
nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88
Earth days.

Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest
object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.
Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface
temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed
mountains

<p>
While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only planet in our solar system with
liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets
closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The
name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for
our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

<p>
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a rocky, cratered body that orbits our planet, appearing bright at
night by reflecting sunlight, and is responsible for Earth's tides due to its gravitational pull. It's tidally
locked with Earth, so we only ever see one side, and its weak atmosphere means no life as we know it exists
there, despite being visited by humans. The Moon constantly moves away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year.

<p>
Mars the fourth planet from the Sun is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic
planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390
kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as
big as a raspberry.
From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from
the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.

<p>
Phobos is the larger, inner moon of Mars, known for its irregular, potato-like shape, cratered surface
(especially Stickney Crater), and very close, fast orbit—circling Mars three times in one Martian day. It's so
close (about 9,375 km from the center) that it orbits faster than Mars rotates, rising in the west and setting
in the east, and is gradually spiraling inward to either crash into Mars or form a ring in about 50 million
years. Its composition is similar to carbon-rich asteroids, and it's covered in grooves, with a surface of loose
dust

<p>
Deimos is the smaller, outer of Mars's two tiny, asteroid-like moons (the other being Phobos), named for the
Greek word for "dread," a son of the war god Ares (Mars). It's a small, irregularly shaped, cratered body, about
12 km (7.5 miles) across, orbiting Mars every 30.3 hours, appearing more like a bright star than a moon from the
surface due to its distance

<p>
Jupiter is the fifth and largest planet in our Solar System, a massive gas giant known for its colorful cloud
bands, rapid rotation (short days), prominent Great Red Spot storm, and large system of moons (like Europa and
Ganymede). It's so big that all other planets could fit inside it, and it plays a crucial role in our cosmic
neighborhood, studied extensively by missions like NASA's Juno spacecraft.

<p>
Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the
only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of
moons.
From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn
system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

<p>
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, an ice giant known for its blue-green color from methane and its
extreme tilt, making it appear to spin on its side, with seasons lasting decades. It's composed of icy fluids
(water, ammonia, methane) over a small rocky core, features faint rings, and has over two dozen moons.
Discovered by William Herschel in 1781, it's named after the Greek god of the sky.

<p>
Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, an ice giant known for its deep blue color from methane
in its atmosphere, extreme winds (over 1,200 mph), faint rings, and 14 known moons (like Triton), with a rocky
core surrounded by icy fluids and a dense atmosphere, often called the "Great Dark Spot" for its storms, and it
takes about 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun. It's a cold, dark, windy world discovered mathematically in 1846
and visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2.
